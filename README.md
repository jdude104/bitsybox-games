# Bitsybox Compatible Games Repository

This is a collection of games that are currently compatible with the [Bitsybox](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsybox) application by adam le doux, with files in the correct .bitsy format for it.

Initial data borrowed from the bitsy archive repo available [here](https://github.com/Ragzouken/bitsy-archive)

Files in Misc are either leftover files from the initial repo, or some utility files that can be ignored
